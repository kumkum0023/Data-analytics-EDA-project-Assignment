# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – PW Skills

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) assignments** completed as part of the  
**Data Science with Generative AI** program by **PW Skills**.

The goal of these projects is to analyze real-world datasets, understand data patterns, handle missing values, detect outliers, and derive meaningful business insights.
